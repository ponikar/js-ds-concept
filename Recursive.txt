// RULES Of RECURSION work as STACK DS

1 -> Always return something (Base Case) otherwise it is gonna be infinite!

2 -> Always try to divide your problem into sub problems (It will make a tree) (Recursive case)

3 -> Don't be consfused over printting stuff;

4 -> in recursive, there is always gonna be conditional flow 

5 -> Always start with small login like making small trees!


Example


function fact(n) {
  // always put base condition at first
	if(n <= 2)
	    return n;
  // this will be your recursive case divide your problem
	return n * fact(n-1); 
}
